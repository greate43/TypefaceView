TypefaceView
================

TextView and EditText views for android which allow the user to set special typefaces; such as the Roboto typefaces (API 10+). 

Pull requests are welcome if you would like to add other typefaces to this library.

To include in your project, add this to your build.gradle file:

```
   //TypefaceView
   compile 'com.github.omadahealth.typefaceview:typefaceview:1.5.0@aar'
```
